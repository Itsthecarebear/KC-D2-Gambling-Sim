(python)

Currently, this is just the basic framework that I am using to start making a replica of the KC:D gambling mini-game. Right now it only runs in the terminal.

Goals:

-~~make framework and basic program~~

-~~add points~~

-expand point system

-add "flavor"
 
	-identify dice to keep, and dice to reroll

	-loop function with only selected diced

-~~logic for maintaining loop only if points are scored (points or bust)~~

	-score for 1s, 5s, trips/quads/septs/sexs
 
	-EACH dice needs own score adding
 
-option to call points amount per turn to allow for score multiplier

	-must be predetermined amounts

-~~difficulty option~~

	-must reach x amount of points
  
-add GUI

-idk what else yet

-PROFIT?!?!
