Currently, this is just the basic framework that I am using to start making a replica of the KC:D gambling mini-game. Right now it only runs in the terminal.

Goals:

-**make framework and basic program**

-**add points**

-add flavor

    -function to choose which dice to keep and which to reroll
 
    -identify 

    -loop function with only selected diced

-**logic for maintaining loop only if points are scored (points or bust)**

	-**score for 1s, 5s, trips/quads/septs/sexs**
 
	-**EACH dice needs own score adding**
 
-option to call points amount per turn to allow for score multiplier

    -must be predetermined amounts

-**difficulty option**

		-**must reach x amount of points**
  
-add GUI
